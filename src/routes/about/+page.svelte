        When I was an elementary student, I didn't participate in any sports until one of my friends invited me to join the Sepak Takraw team for our sports fest. At that time, I didnâ€™t even know how to play the game. He took the time to introduce me to the rules and flow of the game. 
        On the day of the sports fest, I was unsure if I could play. However, when I participated, I discovered that I actually enjoyed it. Our team won that day, and I was selected as a player to represent our school. This was the first time I realized how much I liked Sepak Takraw. We won our district meet, which qualified us for the city meet. During the city meet, we reached the finals, and if we had won, we would have moved on to what they called "CLARAA." Unfortunately, we lost that championship, and while they selected a player to continue, I was not chosen. 
        As I grew older, I continued to play Sepak Takraw during high school and represented my school in the district meet. Sadly, we were unable to make it to the championship during my high school years. 
        Now that I am in college, I tried out for the Sepak Takraw team and was thrilled to be selected as a player representing the CCS department. When the game day arrived, we faced the CHTM department in the first round but we lost, with a final score of 2-0 in the final set. For the championship, we had an intense match against the CEAS department, ending with a score of 2-1 in their favor. Finally, we fought for the bronze medal against the CHTM department once again, and this time we won, securing the bronze for CCS!
